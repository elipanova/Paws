                <div class="itftext">
                    Fostering a pet involves providing temporary care in your home for animals in need. It is an essential part of our mission to save lives and find forever homes for our animals. By becoming a foster parent, you help provide a safe and nurturing environment for pets who are not yet ready for adoption.

                <div class="wftext">
                    Fostering plays a critical role in saving lives. It gives animals a chance to recover, grow, and socialize in a loving home environment. Foster families provide the care and attention these animals need to thrive, which increases their chances of finding a permanent home. For foster families, the experience is incredibly rewarding and offers the opportunity to make a tangible difference in an animal's life.
